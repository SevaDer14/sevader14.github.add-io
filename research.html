                <p class="column-text">
                    Weyl semimetal is a crystal with specific cunducting properties
                    that originate from quantum interactions between electrons and crystal lattice.
                    Those interactions influence electrons that take part in conductivity
                    to become massless quasiparticles - Weyl fermions.
                    Conductivity with such particles has number of benefits that 
                    allow for apllications in spintronics and future computing.

        <h2>My Research in Physics</h2>
        <p>
            While I was employed in Institute of Metal Physics
            of Russian Academy of Science I was involved in galvanomagnetic study of HgSe single crystals 
            doped with small amounts of transition metal impurities
            such as Fe, Co and Ni. During the study we observed anomalus
            galvanomagnetic effects such as extreemley large and linear
            magnetoresistance, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and
            large quantum oscillations in Hall effect. 
        
             During our research we established that probable
             explanation for observed effects can be formation
             of non-centrocymmetric Weyl semimetal phase in 
             our samples. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is Weyl Semimetal?</h2>
        <p>
            In normal metals, such as copper, elementary particles that carry 
            electrical current are electrons. If such is the case
            we say that Fermi level lies in the conduction band (upward directed
            parabolas on the picture) of the material or that conduction band is partially
            filled. In semiconductors like Si or Ge conduction band is empty and thus,
            in normal conditions they do not conduct current and therefore 
            are insuators. However it is possible with addition of 
            dopants, to either add new electrons to the conduction band
            or to take some electrons from valence band (downward directed
            parabolas on the picture). In latter case the conduction of current will happen with qusiparticles
            call holes (lack of electron).
       </p>

            Untill recently that was it. But since the dicovery of
            graphene to wich Nobel prize was awarded new elementary
            particles can be responsible for conducting current in solids.
            That is possible if conduction an valence band interact
            and distort each other. Usually there is a sizable gap between them
            but like on the top picture in some materials they touch each other
            and form new particales. In case of Graphene it is Dirac fermion,
            in Weyl semimetas it is Weyl fermion. Such particles do not have mass
            and therefore conduct current much better, and some times
            due to crazy quantum effects can form Fermi arcs and other chiral anomalies
            that can open a door to new computing methods or allow for high-temperature superconductivity.
